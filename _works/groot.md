blurb: For my STEP internship, I created a full stack web application “gRoot” that displays groups in the G Suite Admin Console using circle-packing, with interactive search and filtering options and editing functionality. Collaborated in a pod of 3 interns and 2 hosts in the Google Cloud Apps Core Admin SRE team and wrote a standard design document detailing project infrastructure and implementation. Used the Google Admin SDK Directory and Google Settings APIs, d3.js visualization library, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) App Engine, Apache Maven, and Jasmine unit testing framework.
