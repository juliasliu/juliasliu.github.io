This past summer of 2020, I was a STEP Intern at Google. I worked on an open-source full-stack web application called "gRoot‚Äù that displays groups in the G Suite Admin Console using circle-packing, with interactive search and filtering options and editing functionality. I collaborated in a pod of 3 interns and 2 hosts in the Google Cloud Apps Core Admin SRE team and wrote a standard design document detailing project infrastructure and implementation.
