This semester, as VP of Marketing, I took charge of redesigning our entire website and leading our online recruitment season for the fall 2020 semester. This involved designing promotional material for social media, scheduling postings and outreach initiatives on Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn, organizing our recruitment timeline and coffee chats, and writing internal and external club newsletters.

As a project manager the previous semester, I led a data analysis consulting project with the Merchandise Control System team at Sephora to extract 11 trends and patterns from the inventory ticket datasets containing 7k+ entries using Python for analysis and Tableau for visualization. We proposed 5 main strategies to increase granularity of the data analysis process and built a Figma web prototype that automates data analysis and visualization.

In the past, I have also worked as a consultant for Tinder, where I conducted user interviews and designed 6 Figma prototypes outlining brand partnerships with transportation, food, and media companies to promote Tinder in Southeast Asia. Prior to that, I was a consultant for Airbnb, where I evaluated adoption rates of various identify verification technology in 7 countries and created Figma web and mobile prototypes proposing the usage of fintech APIs, digital IDs, and telecom providers for the Airbnb universal host identity verification process.
