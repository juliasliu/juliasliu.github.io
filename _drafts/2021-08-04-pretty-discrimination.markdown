caption: Why it doesn't really exist and how it undervalues the benefits of pretty privilege
---
As an avid––and borderline addicted––user of Tiktok, I spend a copious amount of time on the app. This has thus exposed me to a cornucopia of trends, one of which is the topic of #prettyprivilege. While the conversation of pretty privilege has been mulled over countless of times before, what about pretty discrimination?

Tiktok is the type of social media platform where unpopular opinions and hot takes *thrive*. As such, people have easily put their own spin on what "pretty privilege" means to them. These users, predominantly women, talk about how, as someone whom society considers an attractive human being, they *too* face unfair treatment from others because of their looks. In public, they receive judgemental scorns from other women and uncomfortable stares and advances from men; in private, they experience social ostracization due to unwarranted jealousy as well as dismissal of hard work and effort in their careers.

The contrast between users who use this #prettyprivilege hashtag to address how they have been positively affected by this phenomenon versus those who use it to show how unexpectedly burdensome having beauty can be demonstrates an interesting tension between the two sides of the same exact coin... **Hence, why the concept of "pretty discrimination" doesn't really exist.** In other words, pretty discrimination is actually a consequence of pretty privilege.
