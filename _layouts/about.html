							Hi there ‚úåÔ∏è, I am Julia Liu!
						</p>
						<p>
							I graduated from <a class="highlight" href="https://www.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a> in the class of 2022,
							where I received a B.A. in Computer Science, B.S. in Business Administration, and Certificate in Entrepreneurship & Technology.
							Go bears! üêª
						</p>
						<p>
							Now, I am currently a software engineer at <a class="highlight" href="https://google.com/">Google</a> where I work on the 
							Visual Journeys SRE team, responsible for the reliability of Image Search and Google Lens.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the past, I worked as a Product Management Intern at <a class="highlight" href="https://tesla.com/">Tesla</a> on the Global Supercharger Operations team 
							and a Growth Equity Intern at <a class="highlight" href="https://greycroft.com/">Greycroft</a> on the Growth Fund team.

						<p>
							In my free time, I sew my own clothes and accessories. What started out as a quarantine hobby in 2021 became 
							a slightly unhealthy obsession with creating my entire wardrobe from scratch. If you can't find me at my work desk,
							you can find me at my sewing machine.
						</p>
			            <p>
							On days where I am not completely occupied in my sewing corner, I occasionally frequent the dance studio.
							Dance is my only preferred form of exercise, an activity that I do not do much of.
						</p>
						<p>
							I am a hands-on self-learner who loves to create. While I am pretty busy answering to my daytime job, 
							I try to carve some time out of my schedule to get lost in personal projects. 
							Here's to hopefully seeing them come out of the shadows...
