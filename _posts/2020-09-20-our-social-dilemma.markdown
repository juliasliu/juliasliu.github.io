As you may or may not have noticed, I baited you with the tantalizing sight of kimchi beef tofu soup, scallion pancakes, and soju. Such is the lure of ***clickbait***. But since you asked, I visited a couple of friends in Berkeley this past weekend, which was a nice change from the stagnant and boring #WFH life. I ended up eating way too much day, first filling myself with some spicy chilaquiles at Scrambl'z on the Alameda, grabbing boba in Berkeley from Ucha, snaccing on some popcorn chicken while playing Overcooked, and finally emulating Overcooked in real life by chaotically stirring up some delicious dinner with my friends. Don't worry, no one was harmed in the process––only a couple of burnt tongues from trying the hot soup from the pot.

Going back on topic: Clickbait, fake news, polarization, privacy invasion, screen addiction, and insecurities... they are all evil spawns of social media that continue to prey on us every single day whether we are aware of it or not. Since quarantine, we have become even more tied to our phones, computers, and social media, as it is often the only channel of communication we have with our friends.

In thinking about the subtle but surely detrimental effects of social media on our everyday lives, there have been a lot of up and coming conversations surrounding how we, as software engineers and developers behind these technologies, should be taking more accountability for the platforms we create. We've all seen the Netflix documentary, *The Social Dilemma*, or at least have heard whispers about it on, you guessed it, social media. But what exactly is the point of this film, and how are its messages conveyed to the viewers?

To answer the first question, I have no idea. The message of the film was very half-baked; it was unclear whether it was trying to educate its viewers, mobilize them to get off social media or do something to change it, or just be more alert of its potential harmful effects while using it. The CEOs, co-founders, VPs, managers, engineers, and investors who were all invited to answer the questions pitched by the film crew weren't even capable of providing a coherent response to the question: "What is the problem?" So how exactly are we, the general public, who are clearly less knowledgeable about the algorithms and inner workings of these social media apps, able to act against and ultimately help resolve the aforementioned "problem?"

It is more interesting to think about this "problem" through the lens of unique "characters" in the "show." There was a hippie who completely extracted himself from the social media world by deleting all his apps and urges others to do the same. There were software engineers and executives of the big tech social media companies who admitted that they shamelessly created products they even forbid their own children from using. There were other seemingly "woke" individuals who left their previous companies and are now supposedly involved in a who-knows-what initiative to reverse the negative impacts of social media. The issue is that, just with the wide range of people who have worked on these platforms, there is a wide spectrum of users who consume these products as well, which the documentary fails to address.

If you watched the documentary, you probably remember the teenage girl smashing open the glass safe with a hammer in order to retrieve her smartphone from it.
