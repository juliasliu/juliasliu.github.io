Four days ago, I woke up in a drowsy trance, unusually lethargic as I slowly got up from my bed. Normally, the clear blinding sun rays shine through my bedroom window, but today it was replaced by an ominous hazy orange glow.

Perhaps I should have remembered the scarlet red blood moon several nights before. It was like a fearful omen hovering above all of our heads, taunting us––the oblivious citizens who innocently took a night stroll through the neighborhood for some exercise and fresh air. (Photo taken represents our blissful ignorance. I am pictured left.) The red moon knew all too well that in a few days time it would paint the sky an ashy orange, forcing us to lock ourselves up in our homes and deprive us of the happy sunlight we needed to get through our long days.

Since freshman year, the state of California has been, quite literally, on fire. My first fall semester the smoke drifted from the wildfires into the Bay and seeped into our lungs. The memes of AQI over 200 spread as intensely across my Facebook feed as the wildfires themselves. The next semester was strangely normal, but this was just the earth taking in a large gulp of air, waiting to unleash its breath of destruction.

The next fall, we were hit with power outages. The relentless winds and the return of the wildfires scared PG&E to bankruptcy. I remember we were praying every day that school would be cancelled and our midterms would be postponed, due to the lack of electricity required to study and take exams. I would excitedly wake up at 9 am, trudge over to the Asha tea place downtown or Yali's Cafe, and set up my little studying area at a table to catch up on my lectures. Little did I know that these power outages weren't even the worst of it. Not even close.

When the news of a highly contagious virus spreading in Wuhan, China first reached our ears in early February, the U.S. scoffed. There was so much confidence, so much naiveté, that we were in a protective bubble that could not be penetrated by this disease. Fast forward a month later: we were moving out of our dorms and apartments, classes have gone online, club meetings started to take place over Zoom, and gradually, the fear of this pandemic dawned on us.

Now as we sit here in this socially distanced, work-from-home setting, reading the endless news about the red and orange skies, the ravaging pandemic that is still as present as ever, and the hopeless state of American politics, I can't help but feel jaded and hopeless. The depressing photos of the wildfires have finally revealed to people the alarming condition of climate change. The constant lies spewed by our President and his minions are leading the country into a spiral of destruction. The uncertainty surrounding when a vaccine will be effective and released publicly will keep us all inside to mentally and physically rot until we become as withered as the house plants that I have left to die.

Like many others, I am undoubtedly upset by the state of the world at the moment. I am even more irate at the fact that I feel powerless in my ability to help myself and others. I feel as if I am waiting for a mysterious force of nature to lift us all up from this horrible predicament. I am trapped, my sense of time losing its measure of productivity and my college experience slipping away from my fingers.

Hopefully, the world will get better from this sickness that plagues us all. Meanwhile, I will say good night and retreat to my dreams, as it has been awhile since I have slept before midnight.

Until next time!
