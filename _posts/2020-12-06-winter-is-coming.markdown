Game of Thrones is that one show that everyone used to watch, which peer pressured me into hopping onto the bandwagon as well so I could understand references people made to the show, except my smooth pea-sized brain has forgotten about 80% of the plot since I last stopped in season 5 three years ago. All I remember is that I hated Joffrey’s guts and his mother bore a weird resemblance to Bridgit Mendler that I could never stop thinking about.

As the winter season approaches, I look forward to the cozy sweaters I can hibernate in, the warm hot chocolate I can endlessly sip on, and the episodes I can binge on Youtube and Netflix free of the guilt of procrastination. Most of all, I look forward to the double-digit number of hours of sleep I can cram everyday to make up for the measly five I am about to get during the next two weeks.

Winter used to be in the top two of my list of favorite seasons (which I guess doesn’t say much given there are only four in total). I used to prefer the cold weather––snuggling myself up in a dozen layers to hide myself from the world. Strictly in terms of survival, it seemed better to prefer extreme cold over extreme warmth, as you can always layer more clothes but you can’t strip past your skin. I also used to prefer green, blue, purple and silver colors in my clothing and jewelry respectively, as they matched my paler skin tone. I was entranced by the wintery aesthetic of snow falling on rooftops, roasting marshmallows above the fireplace, and mistletoes and jingle bells,  innocently buying into the capitalistic holiday that is Christmas.

Entering college, I witnessed a change in my mindset towards the four seasons as I embraced a dramatic shift in my clothing style––I began to wear more crop tops, spaghetti straps, off-the-shoulder looks, ripped jeans, shorts, cardigans, and gold-toned jewelry. Much of this change was a desperate attempt to expand my closet from the gray hoodies and adidas pants that I wore every single day to high school. I now prefer warm color tones and nude shades of clothing, and take advantage of opportunities where I can photosynthesize in vitamin D due to the insecurity of the paleness of my skin. I look forward to the summer where such opportunities are abundant. At this point of writing, I am unsure if I am roasting myself (aha) for my 180-degree change in style or being unironically accepting of it.

I still love winter, though, as I think I still prefer it more than autumn––maybe because the fall aesthetic doesn't really exist around here, as the trees simply go from being green to being ugly, naked, and dead, without much of that crispy red-orange vibrance of its fallen leaves. The season of spring still tops my list, although its rainy tendencies in the past several years challenges its crown––not that I dislike rain, but I dislike its best friend, wind (I'm tired of having to deal with inverted umbrellas).

Anyway, with upcoming project deadlines for my internship and a tight schedule of cramming in about 45 hours of lectures in less than five days, I am stretched thin on time. I will be taking a short break from blogging for the next two weeks, as I am approaching dead week and final exams. Hopefully, I shall see you on the other side.

Until next time!
