Two weeks ago, I had put down a calendar reminder to redo my website, and alas, after 13 days of glorious procrastination, the deed has been done.

My website was previously hosted on an Amazon Web Services EC2 server instance, which in hindsight was not only hard to maintain and update but was also like sticking a funnel into my wallet and draining it of $20+ every month. Needless to say, I needed to escape from the wrath of Jeff Bezos and his evil minions that are Amazon and its subsidiaries.

I listened to the angel on my shoulder nudging me to host my website on Github Pages and use a static site generator called Jekyll instead, which would alleviate much of the pain I would otherwise go through for setting up my blog. This costed me literally 0 dollars, to my immense satisfaction. It also provided me a free SSL certificate along with the deployment of my website to Github Pages, which I did not previously own.

The home page of my website features an animated Apple Memoji of myself made by yours truly. I used my iPad to record my facial movements, as my ancient iPhone 8 was incapable of such advanced technology. Then, I exported the video to my computer, where I realized to my disappointment that it was not transparent. Thus, I went down a journey of converting the video to a GIF and then proceeding to flip through all 80 frames of the GIF file and deleting the non-transparent backgrounds. Voila!
