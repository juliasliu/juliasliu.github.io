Two weeks ago, I had put down a calendar reminder to redo my website, and alas, after 13 days of glorious procrastination, the deed has been done.

My website was previously hosted on an Amazon Web Services EC2 server instance, which in hindsight was not only hard to maintain and update but was also like sticking a funnel into my wallet and draining it of $20+ every month. Needless to say, I needed to escape from the wrath of Jeff Bezos and his evil minions that are Amazon and its subsidiaries.

I listened to the angel on my shoulder nudging me to host my website on Github Pages and use a static site generator called Jekyll instead, which would alleviate much of the pain I would otherwise go through for setting up my blog. This costed me literally 0 dollars, to my immense satisfaction. It also provided me a free SSL certificate along with the deployment of my website to Github Pages, which I did not previously own. Now you can be rest assured that I am not a hacker stealing your information when you visit my site. Yay!

Now onto a tour of my website!!

The home page of my website features an animated Apple Memoji made by yours truly. I used my iPad to record my facial movements, as my ancient iPhone 8 was incapable of such advanced technology. Then, I exported the video to my computer, where I realized to my disappointment that it was not transparent. Thus, I went down a journey of converting the video to a GIF and then proceeding to flip through all *80 frames of the GIF file* and deleting the non-transparent backgrounds. And voila––now you can see my floating head upon entering my website!

One thing I struggled with for my old website was communicating myself and my experiences. This resulted in a messy amalgamation of the list of classes I took, my job and club descriptions, awards and honors I received, and the skills I had, all in one long scroll. I never really liked the style of regurgitation of my resume on my website and wanted to change it.

Thus, I got rid of the page entirely. R.I.P.

Instead, I focused on dividing my attention between an About page and a Work page. The former I used to basically write my resume in paragraph form. (Insert a painful amount of emojis here.) The latter served as a portfolio of my projects. I sincerely hope you enjoy reading the narcissistic display of all that I have to offer to the world wide webs.

A crystal ball would probably tell me that my website will drastically change in the future. Who knows how many iterations *juliasliu.com* will undergo before its final form. Only time will tell.

Until next time!
