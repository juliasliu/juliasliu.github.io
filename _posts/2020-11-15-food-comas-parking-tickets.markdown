Not only did I empty out my wallet in the name of food this week, but I also racked up $150 worth of parking tickets. What was originally a weekend rendezvous transformed into a week-long extravaganza. Vacant parking spots are already hard to come by on the crowded one-way streets of Berkeley, and being fined $50 for overstaying a 2-hour parking limit feels even more personally cruel, though the limits were designed for that very reason. (Un)fortunately for me, I was fined not once, not twice, but *three* times.

- [x] **In N Out**  
On Friday, I hijacked my parents' car (half-kidding) to use for the rainy drive up to Berkeley. Upon arrival, my friend and I bought a fat gallon jug of Arizona Tea and orange juice from Walgreens, before reuniting with our other floormates. For dinner, we ate double-double cheeseburgers and animal fries, as part of a massive order from In N Out. The cheeseburgers served as a pregame for my stomach, which was filled with more than just tea and orange juice by the end of the night.

- [x] **La Note**  
The next day, I struggled to escape the trap of my blankets to get to brunch, which is perfect for late-risers and egg-lovers--my only two personalities. After failed attempts to eat at La Note, a popular brunch place in downtown Berkeley, I was determined to demolish those scrumptious eggs and pancakes. Dragging my really good friend along with me, we ordered the Lemon Gingerbread Pancakes with Poached Pears and a Cote Nord, which quickly placed us under the spell of a food coma. The pancakes had less of a lemon tinge than I had expected, but I still enjoyed its fluffiness and sugar-packed pears. The Cote Nord, of course, with its finger-licking scrambled eggs and shockingly well-seasoned tomatoes, was *delish*ious.

- [x] **Third Culture**  
Apparently, brunch was so tremendously filling that my really good friend dozed off for fifteen minutes in the car, as I drove to Third Culture Bakery. Though I have had many a mochi pastries from the store before, I wanted to visit the bakery in-person. We ordered a selection of variously flavored mochi donuts and muffins, along with a caramel matcha coffee drink for myself, as I was aching for a shot of caffeine to wake me up. Promptly afterward, we decided to sprawl ourselves out under the blinding sunlight on the Memorial Glade, munching on our Third Culture goods as we offered our bodies to the food coma gods.

- [x] **Walgreens**  
Encouraged by my enabling, we stopped by Walgreens and impulse-bought Taki popcorn and a bag of Kit Kats. The Taki popcorn was love at first sight, and it may have beaten out Jalapeño Cheeto Puffs to become my favorite. It is my religious belief that popcorn is an extremely underrated and versatile snacc. You can coat it in butter, caramel, chocolate, cheddar, pumpkin spice––the possibilities are endless. Addicted to the spicy and sour flavor of the Taki powdered popcorn, I ravenously devoured the entire bag in the span of two days.

- [x] **Poke Parlor**
- [x] **Kansai Sushi**  
I didn't realize my love for raw seafood until I got to college (sorry, mom). My mom is highly skeptical of the unhygienic nature of uncooked seafood, which I totally understand from the horror stories she reads about people becoming vegetables after eating poorly prepared and contaminated fish in Japan. Nonetheless, poke would become my comfort food during my late-night study sessions at the Moffitt Library on campus. Spurred by my poke cravings this weekend, we ordered from Poke Parlor on Telegraph, and a few days later, from Kansai Sushi, further upping my raw fish intake. 

- [x] **Feng Cha**
- [x] **Hui Lau Shan (許留山)**  
A few weeks ago, I volunteered to teach a lecture on CSS animations for the web design decal course, in exchange for a free boba drink from one of the instructors. Naturally, I took advantage of this opportunity to acquire a large Dirty Boba, for maximum caramel indulgence, from Feng Cha, which I shared with my really good friend. A few days later, I was also craving boba from Ucha, which unfortunately did not open by the moment I got there, so I ordered a mango pomelo drink from its neighbor, Hui Lau Shan, instead.

- [x] **Marufuku Ramen**  
Sunday night, we drove to Oakland where we waited 20 minutes in the car to be seated in Marufuku's outdoor dining area. We ordered the Hakata Tonkotsu and Chicken Paitan Deluxe, both pictured above. The tender pork meat of the Hakata Tonkotsu submerged in the warm broth, which was topped with a hard-boiled egg and a generous amount of green onions, radish, wood ear, and bean sprouts, was *delish*ious. Our soups must have been laced with the food coma potion again, as a deep slumber overcame us when we arrived back at the apartment.

- [x] **Yin Ji Chang Fen (银记肠粉)**  
I met up with another friend in Berkeley for lunch one day, where we from this dim sum place located in Northside Berkeley. It was lightly drizzling that day as I awkwardly clobbered my way downtown holding onto my umbrella and plastic bags full of food. We ordered a massive selection of foods, from an assorted congee, marinated shrimp and pork rice noodle rolls, chicken feet with herbs, and dough stick rice noodle roll to fried buns, ginger milk curd, and Hong Kong style milk tea.

- [x] **Sliver Pizzeria**  
Pro-tip: If you want to get your money's worth of pizza, order Sliver five minutes before it closes. We were pleasantly surprised with not one, but *two* extra pizza boxes, along with many boxes of salads, which were unfortunately ruined by goat cheese. As always, Sliver never disappoints as a late-night meal.

Unfortunately, due to COVID-19 complications with restaurant opening times and closings, I was unable to try some of the food places that I had written down in my iPhone notes. Some notable ones include:

- [ ] **Freshroll**: a small Vietnamese restaurant on Telegraph that sells bowls of vermicelli noodles and vegetable and meat toppings
- [ ] **Cheeseboard**: the Northside version of Sliver with a similarly revolving Pizza of the Day menu
- [ ] **U:Dessert Story**: a new dessert place that opened up downtown known for its toasts, cakes, and bingsoo

Happy eating, and until next time!
